          <strong>Polymarket</strong> is a decentralized prediction market platform where users can trade
          on the outcomes of real-world events â€” like elections, geopolitical developments, and major news stories.
          Prices on Polymarket reflect collective beliefs about the likelihood of events, often updating faster
          than traditional media or polling.
